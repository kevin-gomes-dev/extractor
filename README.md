# extractor
Small messy python script to extract all files from a directory/subs into another directory. Currently need to edit the .py to change paths, choose reversing or moving, and the exts you want. Changes to this should be done such that we either have a terminal interface for choosing these or a gui accessing some kind of config file. QtWidget + a config for saved extensions and paths would do nicely.
